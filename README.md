This is my first project on Django 4.2.20

I so... hate web-developing, its too crazy

So I need to explain this code for future me, if i want to use this one more time

Well, to start u need install requirements via pip install -r requirements.txt

Then u have to set up nginx config at /etc/nginx/sites-available/
I put example at this repository
There are also phpmyadmin, if u need this

And the last is start app by command ./start
Thats all, a believe u can do this
Good luck
